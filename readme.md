# Digital CV Exchange Specification

A JSON-based CV specification to make it easier for you to demonstrate your carrier as resume or any other formats.

## Why We Need This?

We already have a *JSON Resume* for JSON-based resume standard. But it's not easy to use and the reasons are following:

1. Resume is for job applying, so it doesn't make sense to update it often without a clear target. So when the time really comes for changing a job, many people usually have no preparation and have to scramble for it.

2. For each different job (or even each different company), we need a specific resume to apply, which is mostly time consuming and copy-paste job.

However, a CV (Curriculum Vitae), in contradictory, is an in-depth document that contains details about a person's professional experience, accomplishments and qualifications. It can be, and should be, updated often whenever you achieve something remarkable. If you have a well-maintained CV, it will be much easier to assemble a resume just by picking some shinning points from it.

To achieve that, introducing **Digital CV Exchange Specification**, a CV version of *JSON Resume*, to make your career well-tracked and easy to demonstrate.

## Principles

**THE TRUST FROM THE PUBLIC IS THE LIVE OF THIS PROJECT.**

To earn the trust, we make several principles and should keep them in mind all the time when contributing to this project.

1. **Privacy ans Security:** A well-maintained CV usually contains many sensitive info that you don't want some others fully know. Each pace of this project should ensure that both business secret and personal privacy will be absolutely safe.
2. **Extensible:** All kinds of data should be able to put in.
3. **Standardized:** Standardize as much fields as possible to make the data more portable among variant data processing systems. And all standardized structures should be well-documented - For the convenience of developers, and for the easier adoption by companies.
5. **Acceptance:** Respect the diversity of our community and keep neutral in sensitive issues (especially for the things political or religious).

## Privacy

Both *business secret* and *personal privacy* are extremely important to this project. They're the fundamental for us to get trust from the public.

So for every single feature, the proposal should be raised publicly and last a long enough period for the public to review. Any concern about privacy should be resolved before the feature publishing.

**Notice:** The definition of *privacy* may be variant in different cultures. For example, in many countries, info like gender, birthday or even photo are sensitive and should be avoided in resume; however, in some countries, they are not. In respect of these cultural difference, we should design the data structure that able to collect all possible information, but make them optional as much as we can and tailor them when needed.

## Naming

The project's name **Digital CV Exchange** is originally inspired by *DDEX (Digital Data Exchange)*. But it seems not as easy as *DDEX* to remember, and it sounds like a subset of *DDEX* (maybe it should).

If you have a better idea for the project's name, please feel free to raise it. We may change it when this project moving into a stable version (1.0.0).
